# spectHR - Cardiovascular Spectral Analysis Toolkit

`spectHR` is a Python library designed for interactive analysis of time series data, particularly focused on ECG and breathing patterns. The library provides tools for detecting peaks (R-tops) in ECG data, spectral analysis, and interactive visualization of time series data. It includes various modes for modifying, selecting, and analyzing R-tops and other key events in the data.

## Features

- **ECG and Breathing Pattern Analysis**: Process and analyze time series data, including ECG and breathing patterns.
- **Peak Detection (R-tops)**: Automatically detect R-top times in ECG signals.
- **Interactive Plotting**: Use draggable vertical lines to visualize and manipulate R-tops within a plot.
- **Zoom and Epoch Selection**: Interactively zoom into regions of interest and select epochs for marking.
- **Spectral Analysis**: Perform cardiovascular spectral analysis to study heart rate variability and other metrics.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter notebook or JupyterLab
- ipywidgets
- Voil√† (for interactive visualization)

### Install the library

You can install `spectHR` using pip:

```bash
pip install spectHR
```
Or, if you're developing locally, clone the repository and install it in editable mode:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spectHR.git
cd spectHR
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
To use spectHR in your Jupyter notebook, import the necessary components and load your ECG data for analysis.

```python
import spectHR as cs

# Example: Load ECG data and perform peak detection
DataSet = cs.SpectHRDataset("Example Data/SUB_002.xdf") 
DataSet = cs.calcPeaks(DataSet)
```
Once the data is loaded, you can visualize it with interactive plots:

```python
GUI = cs.spectplot(DataSet)  # Plot ECG with draggable R-top lines
```

### Available Modes

Drag: Move the vertical lines (R-tops) along the x-axis to adjust detection.
Remove: Select and remove individual R-tops by clicking on the lines.
Add: Add a new R-top at a specific location on the plot.
Find: Identify peaks within a selected x-range.

This will allow you to interact with the ECG plot, dragging R-top lines and updating the dataset accordingly.
